\usage{
isFeasible(E, warn = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{E}{an \code{\link{editmatrix}}, \code{\link{editarray}} or \code{\link{editset}}}

\item{warn}{logical: should a warning be emitted when system is infeasible?}
}
\value{
TRUE or FALSE
}
\description{
When variables are \code{\link[=eliminate]{eliminated}} one by one
from a set of edits, eventually either no edits are left or an 
\code{\link[=isObviouslyInfeasible]{obvious contradiction}} is encountered.
In the    case no records can obey all edits in the set which is therefore
\code{inFeasible}.
}
\note{
This function can potentially take a long time to complete, especially
when many connected (conditional) edits are present. Consider using \code{\link{blocks}}
to check feasibility of indendent blocks.
