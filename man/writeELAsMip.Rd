\title{Rewrite an editset and reported values into the components needed for a mip solver}
\usage{
writeELAsMip(E, x, weight = rep(1, length(x)), M = 1e+07, epsilon = 0.001, ...)

\arguments{
\item{E}{\code{\link{editset}} or any object that is coercable to an editset.}

\item{x}{named \code{list} or \code{vector} with data}

\item{weight}{vector with weights of the variable in the same order as x}

\item{M}{maximum allowed difference between reported value and corrected value}

\item{epsilon}{offset needed for writing a strict inequality into a an inequality}
}
\value{
list with an editmatrix, objfn, binvars, numvars, M and epsilon
}
