\description{
An edit defines a subregion of the space of all possible value combinations 
of a record. Records in this region are interpreted as invalid. An edit rule
which defines a region equal to or contained in the region defined by another
edit is redundant. (In data editing literature, this is often referred to as 
a \emph{domination} relation.)
